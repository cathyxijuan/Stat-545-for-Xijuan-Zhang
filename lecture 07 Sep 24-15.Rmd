```{r setup, include= F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo =T)
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
The name of the chunk is consistent with the figure name in the folder
**The teacher want us to commit everything except the html; but she can if we want to **
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} 
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
